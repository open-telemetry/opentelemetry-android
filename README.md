# About

The repository contains the OpenTelemetry Android SDK for generating mobile
client telemetry for real user monitoring (RUM). It is built on top
of the [OpenTelemetry Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java).

# Getting Started

> If your project's minSdk is lower than 26, then you must enable
> [corelib desugaring](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support#library-desugaring).
> See [#73](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-android/issues/73) for more information.
> If your project's minSdk is lower than 24, in order to run instrumentation tests or run the app
> built on debug, you must use AGP 8.3.0+ and set the `android.useFullClasspathForDexingTransform`
> property in `gradle.properties` to `true` to ensure desugaring runs properly. For the full
> context for this workaround, please see
> [this issue](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/230454566#comment18).

    implementation("io.opentelemetry.android:android-agent:0.6.0-alpha")
    //...
}
```

# Features

This android library builds on top of
the [OpenTelemetry Java SDK](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java).
Some of the additional features provided include:

* Crash reporting
* ANR detection
* Network change detection
* Full Android Activity and Fragment lifecycle monitoring
* Access to the OpenTelemetry APIs for manual instrumentation
* Helpers to redact any span from export, or change span attributes before export
* Slow / frozen render detection
* Offline buffering of telemetry via storage

Note: Use of these features is not yet well documented.
