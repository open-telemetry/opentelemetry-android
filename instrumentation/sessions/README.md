# Session Instrumentation

Out of the box, the `opentelemetry-android` agent will create and manage sessions. Sessions are associated
with a unique identifier and will expire after a duration. This instrumentation is responsible
for adding a `SessionObserver` instance that will generate OpenTelemetry events for
`session.start` and `session.end` when interesting things happen to the session.

See [session.md in the semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/general/session.md)
for additional details about sessions.

See ["Session Events"](https://github.com/open-telemetry/semantic-conventions/blob/main/docs/general/session.md#session-events)
for more information about the specific events generated by this instrumentation.

## Session ID Integration

Session identifiers (`session.id` and `session.previous_id`) are automatically added to telemetry across the SDK:

### Spans and Logs
- **Spans**: Session IDs are added via `SessionIdSpanAppender` processor
- **Logs**: Session IDs are added via `SessionIdLogRecordAppender` processor
- **Applies to**: All spans and logs across all instrumentations

### Metrics
- **Added via**: `SessionInjectingMetricExporter` adapter
- **Applies to**: All metric data points before export

### Event-Generating Instrumentations
The following instrumentations emit events with session identifiers:
- **ANR** - Application Not Responding events
- **Crash** - Crash report events
- **Compose Click** - Jetpack Compose UI click events
- **View Click** - Android View click events
- **Slow Rendering** - Jank/frame drop events
- **Startup** - App initialization events
- **Network** - Network state change events
- **OkHttp3 WebSocket** - WebSocket connection events

**Note**: Lifecycle instrumentations (Activity, Fragment) and HTTP interceptors (OkHttp3) generate spans, not events, so they receive session IDs via the span processor.

## Installation

This instrumentation comes with the [android agent](../../android-agent) out of the box, so
if you depend on it, you don't need to do anything else to install this instrumentation.
However, if you don't use the agent but instead depend on [core](../../core) directly, you can
manually install this instrumentation by following the steps below.

### Adding dependencies

```kotlin
implementation("io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation:sessions:0.16.0-alpha")
```
