# Network Change Instrumentation

Status: development

Android applications are typically deployed on mobile devices. These mobile devices
have the ability to move between networks, and sometimes a network change can
have an impact on application performance characteristics. This instrumentation
will generate telemetry when the network changes, as detected
via [ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/net/ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback).

This instrumentation only generates telemetry when the application is in the foreground,
not when the application is backgrounded.

## Telemetry

This instrumentation produces the following telemetry:

### Network Change

* Type: Event
* Name: `network.change`
* Description: This event is emitted when a network change is detected.
* Attributes:
    * `network.status`: One of `lost` or `available`.
    * `network.connection.type` (semconv) one of `cell`, `wifi`, `wired`, `unavailable`, `unknown`, `vpn`.

Note: This instrumentation supports additional user-configurable `AttributeExtractors` that
may set additional attributes when given a `CurrentNetwork` instance.

The `CurrentNetworkAttributesExtractor` class is configured by default and provides additional information about the
current network, depending on the Android version and permissions granted. In particular, The app must declare the
required permission [READ_PHONE_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_PHONE_STATE) or
[READ_BASIC_PHONE_STATE](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#READ_BASIC_PHONE_STATE) (API 33+)
in its manifest and request it at runtime to extract the mobile network type (e.g., LTE, 5G) and to access the standardized
carrier name mapped by Android (e.g., "T-Mobile-US"). Without this permission, only the SIM-provided carrier name (e.g., "T-Mobile")
is available. See [Android permissions documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview) for more details.

## Installation

This instrumentation comes with the [android agent](../../android-agent) out of the box, so
if you depend on it, you don't need to do anything else to install this instrumentation.
However, if you don't use the agent but instead depend on [core](../../core) directly, you can
manually install this instrumentation by following the steps below.

### Adding dependencies

```kotlin
implementation("io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation:network:0.13.0-alpha")
