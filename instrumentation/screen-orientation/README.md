Status: development

The OpenTelemetry screen orientation instrumentation for Android will detect when the screen
orientation changes.

## Telemetry

This instrumentation produces the following telemetry, with an instrumentation
scope of `io.opentelemetry.screen_orientation`.

## Installation

This instrumentation comes with the [android agent](../../android-agent) out of the box, so
if you depend on it, you don't need to do anything else to install this instrumentation. However, if
you don't use the agent but instead depend on [core](../../core) directly, you can
manually install this instrumentation by following the steps below.
