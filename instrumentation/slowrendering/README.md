# Slow Rendering Instrumentation

Status: experimental

The OpenTelemetry slow rendering instrumentation for Android will detect when
the application user interface is slow or frozen.
[See the Android documentation for a discussion of UI "jank"](https://developer.android.com/studio/profile/jank-detection).

The instrumentation operates by periodically polling for frame metrics, by default
every 1 second.

## Telemetry

This instrumentation produces the following telemetry, with an instrumentation
scope of `io.opentelemetry.slow-rendering`.

### Slow Renders

Generated when rendering takes more than 16ms.

* Type: Span (zero duration)
* Name: `slowRenders`
* Description: This event is emitted when frame metrics contain at least
  one render duration longer than 16ms.
* Attributes:
  * `count` - the number of slow renders
  * `activity.name` - the name of the activity for which the slow render was detected

### Frozen Renders

Generated when rendering takes more than 700ms.

* Type: Span (zero duration)
* Name: `frozenRenders`
* Description: This event is emitted when frame metrics contain at least
  one render duration longer than 700ms.
* Attributes:
    * `count` - the number of slow renders
    * `activityName` - the name of the activity for which the slow render was detected
