# OpenTelemetry Android Volley Instrumentation

> :construction: &nbsp;Status: Experimental

This directory contains OpenTelemetry instrumentation for the [Volley](https://google.github.io/volley/)
HTTP client library. If you use the Volley HTTP client in your Android application, you can
leverage this instrumentation to help simplify tracing and capture of HTTP headers.

## Add to your project

To use this library instrumentation, you will need to add
the dependency in your `build.gradle.kts`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation("io.opentelemetry.android:instrumentation-volley:{version}")
    ...
}
```

## How to use VolleyTracing

To use `VolleyTracing`, you must have already initialized `OpenTelemetryRum`.
To build an instrumented client HTTP call, you will first create an instance of
`VolleyTracing` by passing in the `OpenTelemetry` instance from the `OpenTelemtryRum`
instance to the builder:

```java
VolleyTracing volleyTracing = VolleyTracing.builder(otelRum.getOpenTelemtry()).build();
```

You can also add extra request/response headers to capture to the builder.
These headers will be attached to the RUM Volley HTTP client spans with
`http.request.header.` or `http.response.header.` respectively.

Next, get an instance of `HurlStack` from your `volleyTracing` instance:

```java
HurlStack hurlStack = volleyTracing.newHurlStack();
```

Then, use the `hurlStack` to create your request queue and send requests like you normally would.

# Troubleshooting
