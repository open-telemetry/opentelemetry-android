# Compose Instrumentation

Status: development

## Compose version
`1.3.0` to `1.5.4`

This instrumentation has the ability to generate events when the user
performs click actions. A click is not differentiated from touch or other
input pointer events.

When an Activity becomes active, the instrumentation begins tracking
its window by registering a callback that receives events.

This instrumentation is not currently enabled by default.

## Telemetry

Data produced by this instrumentation will have an instrumentation scope
name of `io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation.compose.click`.
