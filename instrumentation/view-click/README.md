# View Click Instrumentation

Status: development

This instrumentation has the ability to generate events when the user
performs click actions. A click is not differentiated from touch or other
input pointer events.

When an Activity becomes active, the instrumentation begins tracking
its window by registering a callback that receives events.

This instrumentation is not currently enabled by default.

Data produced by this instrumentation will have an instrumentation scope
name of `io.opentelemetry.android.instrumentation.view.click`.
